            <h3> What Turtles? </h3> <!-- This section describes what a sea turtle is including how many species there are, where they live, and how they reproduce so that readers know what I am talking about when I talk about saving them. --> 
            
                <p> Sea turtles are one of the oldest creatures on the earth, having been around since the time of the dinosaurs. There are about 7 different species alive today. Sea turtles live in all warm bodies of waters in the world. They live most of their lives in water, coming back to shore only to give birth. Females lay eggs in the same place where they were hatched. The gender of the turtle depends upon what temperature the egg is nested at. Many culures value sea turtles as spiritual and wise beings. </p>

It is also an emotional appeal for saving them (because they're so cute!) --> 
                
            <h3> The Problem: </h3> <!-- This describes why the turtles are in danger. --> 
            
                <p> Plastic never breaks down. It is only broken down or "micronized". Almost all major companies use plastic to package their products. </p> 
                    
                <p> Sea turtles primarily eat jellyfish, seaweed, and sponges throughout their lives. Turtles do not have perfect vision so they can confuse plastic bags and jelly fish. Newly-hatched turtles eat whatever floats by them as their swimming skills are not yet fully developed. Because of this, baby turtles often eat microplastics that are present in all oceans. <!--Add facts ab scientists finding plastic in stomach of turtles. --> </p>

They are of turtles in plastic, which shows the immensity of this issue and some other posters encouraging people to save the turtles. --> 
            
            <h3> What YOU Can Do: </h3> <!-- This section tells how to decrease the amount of plastic in the ocean. --> 
            
                <p> In order to decrease the amount of plastic in the ocean, we can choose to use reusable bags instead of plastic bags. When we do use plastic bags we must make an effort to find places to recycle them. Many Wawas in Delaware have recycling bins that accept plastic bags. </p> 
            
                <p> In addition, we can deny using straws at restaurants. Simply politely tell your waiter or waitress "No thank you". If you would still like to use a straw, you can invest in a reusable metal straw to carry around. There are also paper straw options that can be recycled after use. </p>
                
                <p> Consider buying a reusable water bottle instead of plastic ones. This will save the planet and save you money in the long run! </p> 
            
                <p> If you are REALLY motivated to help and live near an ocean, you can volunteer with your local Parks and Recreation Department to clean the shoreline at the beach.</p>

It is an example of a reusable water bottle which will help reduce plastic use and save the turtles! --> 
        
            <h3> What Others Are Doing: </h3>
            
                <p>Here are some organizations working to save the turtles!</p>
            
                            <ul> <!-- These are links to and descriptions of charities that help save the turtles. --> 
                                <li> <a href="https://4ocean.com/pages/sea-turtle">4ocean</a> hosts beach and ocean cleanups around the world where each participant is encouraged to pick up 1 pound of debris. They also sell bracelets. The proceeds go to funding their cleanups as well as other marinelife conservation efforts. </li>
                                
                                <li> <a href="http://www.sailorsforthesea.org/programs/ocean-watch/skip-straw-%E2%80%93-save-turtle">Sailors for the Sea</a> is a group of fishers, sailors, and scientists who have witnessed the effects of plastic polution first hand. They go out in their boats and clean up trash that would have otherwise ended up in the stomach of a turtle.</li>
